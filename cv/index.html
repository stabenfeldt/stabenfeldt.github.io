    Scandinavian Online - Sol.no
    04.05.2015 - present
    Senior System Developer

    As of october 2016, SOL and Dagbladet’s development teams joined forces.
    We’re now working cross organizations. I’m now currently working with ads, DFP and ADx.


    I'm developing front and backend systems supporting the news aggregator Sol.no.

    - I implemented Elasticsearch and added a range of new API endpoints we could filter and fetch news articles from.
    - Also built an extensive test suite for our Node.js backend software.
    - Made a Docker based system for starting a MongoDB cluster with an Elasticsearch search engine. https://github.com/soldotno/elastic-mongo

    Our technology stack consists of Elasticsearch, MongoDB, Node.js, React, Heroku and Docker.




    Orwapp AS
    2014 - 2016
    Founder and CTO

    Orwapp’s goal was to make construction sites paperless. Instead of having Post-It notes handed around and accumulated in a spreadsheet, we gave the workers and management a digital platform to delegate tasks. Working hours and billable hours was generated based on the hours the construction workers reported. We got Alliero to found our first beta version.
    My role in Orwapp was to design and implement the entire product. The main app and API backend was built in Rails. I also got a lot of experience of hiring and managing remote teams with developers recruited at Elance. These developers were located in Pakistan, India and Poland.

    Making sure the quality of the remote workers was as expected was challenging. I got a decent routine of having the developers submit screencasts of the features they had implemented when they submitted pull requests. Rubocop code linter was used to enforce coding rules and best practises were followed.

    As my partner and me had different visions of the product’s future, he bought my part of the stocks early 2016.




    
    Kaffesmak
    2012 - 2014
    Founder and CTO



    A mini startup I did. Following the build, measure, learn cycle introduced by Eric Ries and the Lean Startup movement. It started as an app to rate coffee. After a pivot it turned into a curated coffee subscription. I shipped coffee all over Norway, Baltimore and even Tokyo.
    I built a Rails app that promoted the different subscription models, accepted credit card payments and generated a list of which customers who I should ship coffee to each month. Payments was accepted through Paymill.


    Amedia Utvikling AS
    01.10.2013 - 01.01.2015
    Senior System Developer

    I was part of a small group that developed Trenger.no. It was a inhouse startup in Amedia AS. The goal was to build a system for classified ads that would be integrated with some of the newspapers Amedia owns. Trenger.no didn’t get the traction anticipated by the board of Amedia, so it was terminated early 2015.
    Technology used: Rails, Elasticsearch and MongoDB.



    Make Websolutions
    09.07.2012 - 01.10.2013
    Senior System Developer

    - Did a rewrite of the old ASP version of MakeNewsmail.no. An email marketing and email list manager. The new version consists of Rails, PostgreSQL and a few Sinatra apps. All running on Heroku.

    - Developed Julekalender.com with Torbjørn Tiltnes. Julekalender.com is a Rails app that runs on Heroku with a PostgreSQL database. Even though it had more than 1000 users clicking around the site simultaneously, it was ranked as the third fastest SaaS (consumer) app in December 2012.

    - Introduced the old team for Scrum and TDD. We started working in short weekly sprints with continuous deployment. CircleCi took care of building and deployment. Code Climate gave us a heads up if our Ruby has code smells or security issues.




    
    Companybook AS
    31.08.2010 - 09.07.2012
    Senior System Developer



    I was a part of the core team that designed and implemented Companybook.no
    We started by running our services on 20 servers in Amazon’s cloud. Later on we moved to a combination of 30 physical and virtual servers at RackSpace.

    - Developed and deployed Ruby on Rails applications in RackSpace and Amazon´s cloud.
    - Wrote Chef recipes to install and maintain the software on our servers.

    - Installed and maintained Jenkins / Hudson for continuous deployment to our production servers.

    - Turning heavy desktop pages into lightweight mobile friendly ones.
    Unfortunately, mobile clients was not taken into consideration in the first iterations.
    Thus, a mobile first approach was out of the question. To give the best ROI, I adapted the pages we already had into mobile friendly ones, using a combination of Media Queries and JavaScript.

    Open source

    https://github.com/stabenfeldt
    I submit small patches every time I find errors in projects that I use.
    Sometimes I implement entire feature requests.

    Spare time
    I enjoy bouldering / climbing, road- and mountain-biking during the summer.
    Cross-country skiing wintertime. I was a part of the Rye17 cycling team 2010. We completed Trondheim-Oslo on 17 hours and 41 minutes that year.



    Projects
    iSola
    I’ve created a small iPhone app using RubyMotion. It´s an app that lets the user see which outdoor dinings that have sun right now. Nothing fancy, just to get familiar with RubyMotion and it’s ecosystem.

    Oslo Startup Weekend (Autumn 2015)
    I missed the positive energy from the SW, so I joined it again. This time I joined a team that wanted to build a rescue drone saving people from avalanches. Our team got the 1st price.

    Oslo Startup Weekend (Spring 2013)
    I was so thrilled about last year’s experience that I attended this year too. This time we got second place.

    Oslo Startup Weekend (Spring 2012)
    I attended Oslo Startup Weekend for the first time. I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and actually see how far one could get building a new product in only 52 hours.
    In Norway we destroy food for several millions every year. We wanted to create an app, that grocery stores could use to promote groceries that are about to expire. Martin Lie and me did the programming, while the three others on the team created a business plan. Our prototype was created using MVC framework SpineJS and CoffeeScript. Out of 17 competing teams, we ended up on a 3rd place.
    WordGame
    Every now and then I look up French words, but I don´t always remember them the first time. Therefor I started working on a webapp for iPhone. This app presents the last 10 words I've looked up in two columns. French words and English words. When I select a matching pair they disappear from the list. WordGame saves the results from Bing Translate in a SQLite database on the client side. This makes the memorization part of the app fully functional even without an internet connection.
    - Initially written using vanilla JavaScript and HTML, later on rewritten to use jQuery Mobile and finally in a MVC pattern using CoffeeScript and SpineJS.


    TapeRecorder
    I decided to create a desktop application with Flex 4 / Air to get more familiar with ActionScript 3.0. This application presents the user with a couple of radio stations. He can then pick one, choose what hour the recording should stop and start, and which days to repeat. A cronjob is generated to handle the stop and start scripts. The stop script takes use of the PodcastGenerator.pm module I´ve previously written and generates XML that the user can use to subscribe within iTunes.

    PodcastGenerator
    As NRK didn’t provide their radio shows as podcasts, I developed a podcast generator with Perl. This converted the Windows Media encoded stream to MP3 and generated an RSS feed I could subscribe to with iTunes.
    Searching for some books to learn french, on Cappelen.no, I noticed they had some french news-tickers. These presented an article from today's news in a short and precise manner. Accompanied by a MP3 where the article was read out loud, perfect for me trying to learn french. As I already had written a podcast-generator, it wasn't really hard to write something that fetched the latest MP3 and article generating a RSS feed from that.



    SqueakSMS (2007)
    Some friends of mine asked me if I could help them sending SMS to their members list when they was booked for a gig. First I developed a Perl script to do the job. As this made them dependent of me sitting in front of the computer every time they wanted to send messages, I wanted to give them their own web interface to manage the job. This application let their blog readers subscribe to the list by themselves. Rails looked like the right tool to do the job. It was a great way to get familiar with Rails and Test Driven Development. This application has grown to be my own primary tool for sending SMS messages.
